Hi!

To put it simply, I like to design and develop products.

Yeah that's simple.

I am a 20 year old junior Software developer from Tallinn, Estonia 

My main programming story starts around 2016 when I started studying Software Development in the Tallinn Polytechnic School. Ever since I have been working in the development sector for smaller companies, developing websites and creating software on my own. 

My curriculum revolved around C# but that wasn't the only thing I got out of the school. 

I got the base knowledge for creating web applications in Vue, got hands on practice with MySQL relational databases and overall database handling. 

I got to lead many smaller IT-projects with great people and develop exciting software and still do to this day. 

In 2018 I landed a sweet spot in a small IT-tech company both as a Software developer and an IT-specialist, the intention was to get an intern spot but this later has molded into a Junior Software Developer title. Now I pretty much re-design old websites and also migrate many sites to the newer JAMStack side of tech. 

Along the way at school, I got to play a huge role at many of my school clubs. Halfway through 2016 I got elected as the vice-frontman of the student council, later int 2017 I was elected as the frontman of the student council board. 

It was an exciting small addition to the day-to-day life in school, I got to organize and plan many events at our school. My biggest contributions were to renovate the existing student councils room and organize a proper work-flow documentation for the next boards to use. 

In 2019 I ended school with a great speech and an even greater gold medal. Personally, each time I hear someone has a gold medal at school I always have sense of "repulse, as to why are they any better than the others that didn't get a medal?

The truth is, they aren't, the stories behind the medals, degree papers and victories are so vast and different, it's slightly selfish to form up some type of judgment upon a person due to what they have been given. 

I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter and are meaningful.

Thus If my work gets a medal or not, It's not that that matters, but the journey went through, the battles fought and the failures we've experienced.
