I am a young software and web developer from Tallinn Estonia.

My programming story is quite fresh, I started studying Software Development in 2016 at the _Tallinn Polytechnic school_, which led me down the web-dev-hill, ever since then I've been consuming an ungodly amount of knowledge.

Ended school in 2019 with a gold medal for _"great contribution to school"_, yeah I'm a bit proudy.

I enjoy programming as much as the next person, but more often I find myself on the front-end side of things.  
I really enjoy the design process and visuals when it comes to making great products, the creative freedom to make a product look and feel the way you want it is so valuable to me, thus I have recently been more addicted to front-end development and UI/UX design.

Besides that, so far I've rummaged around the desktop apps of C#, visual basic and .NET programs, dabbled in python web scraping, but mostly been developing websites with many web-frameworks such as Vue and Hugo.

I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
