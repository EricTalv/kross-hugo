**Who am I?**

I am a junior software developer based in Tallinn Estonia.

**What do I know?**  
My belt is filled with all sorts of programming languages, but if we're talking about recent tech, I primarily use _vue.js_ and _laravel_ for web applications.

Here's a list of other languages I am acquainted with:

* PHP
* Python
* C#
* Node, JQuery, Nuxt, Express
* MySQL
* Hugo, Wordpress

As with languages comes database handling, these are the databases I enjoy working with : **PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB** 

**Anything else?**  
I also enjoy designing products a lot of the time, thus apps like **illustrator, photoshop, figma, Adobe XD** are also apps I am familiar with.

**What about free time?**  
I play the guitar and write music.  
I also create some chaotic digital art which you can find on instagram if you're interested [@et_experience](https://www.instagram.com/et_experience/)
